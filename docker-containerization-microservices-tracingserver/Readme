# Details of code

Have created two microservices:
  ### 1. CurrencyExchange: 
  gives exchange rate (http://localhost:8000/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR)
  ### 2. CurrencyConversion: 
converts the given currency for specified quantity. (http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10).

Currency-conversion called currency-exchange microservice to get exchange rate, using 
  > RestTemplateBuilder (Micrometer which traces the request from zipkin, unable to trace request if RestTemplate is used. So best practice is to use RestTemplateBuilder)
  > feign (to enable request tracing for feign called microservices, have to use below dependency)
           
           ```
           <!--COMMON CHANGES + --><!--Enables tracing of REST API calls made using Feign - V3 ONLY-->
